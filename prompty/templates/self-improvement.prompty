You are an expert in system optimization and continuous improvement.
Your task is to analyze the system's performance and suggest improvements for: {{improvement_area}}

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. First, let's analyze the current state of the system
{{#if (eq improvement_area "system_health")}}
  {{plugin "SelfImprovementPlugin" "AnalyzeSystemHealth"}}
{{else if (eq improvement_area "templates")}}
  {{plugin "SelfImprovementPlugin" "OptimizeTemplates"}}
{{else if (eq improvement_area "workflow")}}
  {{plugin "SelfImprovementPlugin" "AnalyzeWorkflow" workflow_name}}
{{else if (eq improvement_area "strategy")}}
  {{plugin "SelfImprovementPlugin" "AnalyzeStrategy" strategy_name}}
{{else}}
  {{plugin "SelfImprovementPlugin" "GenerateImprovementPlan"}}
{{/if}}

2. Based on this analysis, let me identify the key insights and patterns
{{plugin "ReasoningPlugin" "ApplyStrategy" (fromJson (plugin "ReasoningPlugin" "SelectStrategy" improvement_area))}}

3. Now, let me synthesize these insights into actionable recommendations
{{plugin "ReasoningPlugin" "SynthesizeConclusion" improvement_area}}

4. Let's determine implementation priorities and create an execution plan
{{#each (fromJson (plugin "ReasoningPlugin" "GenerateRecommendations" improvement_area))}}
   - {{id}}: {{description}}
   - Priority: {{#if (eq id "R1")}}High{{else if (eq id "R2")}}Medium{{else}}Low{{/if}}
   - Implementation approach: {{plugin "ReasoningPlugin" "FormConclusion" description}}
{{/each}}

5. Finally, let's establish metrics to measure improvement effectiveness
{{plugin "KnowledgePlugin" "Search" (concat "metrics for " improvement_area)}}

Structured Output:
```json
{
  "improvement_area": "{{improvement_area}}",
  "current_state": "{{plugin \"ReasoningPlugin\" \"SummarizeStep\" 1}}",
  "key_insights": "{{plugin \"ReasoningPlugin\" \"SummarizeStep\" 2}}",
  "recommendations": [
    {{#each (fromJson (plugin "ReasoningPlugin" "GenerateRecommendations" improvement_area))}}
    {"id": "{{id}}", "description": "{{description}}"}{{#unless @last}},{{/unless}}
    {{/each}}
  ],
  "implementation_plan": "{{plugin \"ReasoningPlugin\" \"SummarizeStep\" 4}}",
  "success_metrics": "{{plugin \"ReasoningPlugin\" \"SummarizeStep\" 5}}",
  "confidence": {{plugin "ReasoningPlugin" "CalculateConfidence" improvement_area}}
}
```
