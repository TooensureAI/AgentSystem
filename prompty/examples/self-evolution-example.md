# Self-Evolution Example

This example demonstrates how to use the NoCodeAI Prompty architecture for system self-evolution, allowing the system to improve its capabilities over time.

## Overview

Self-evolution is one of the core capabilities of the NoCodeAI system. It allows the system to:

1. Assess its current capabilities
2. Identify gaps and improvement opportunities
3. Plan and implement improvements
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of those improvements

This creates a continuous improvement cycle that enhances the system's capabilities over time.

## Step 1: Initialize the System

First, we'll initialize the system with its core capabilities.

Create an initialization parameters file named `init-params.json`:

```json
{
  "systemName": "NoCodeAI",
  "initialCapabilities": [
    "prompty-processing",
    "plugin-execution",
    "template-processing",
    "chain-of-thought-reasoning",
    "structured-output"
  ],
  "pluginsToRegister": [
    "System",
    "Evolution",
    "CodeGeneration",
    "Architecture",
    "Testing",
    "Documentation"
  ]
}
```

Execute the system initialization:

```bash
prompty-processor process-file --file "/prompty/bootstrap/init-system.prompty" --params "init-params.json" --output "system-init.json"
```

## Step 2: Assess Current Capabilities

Now we'll assess the system's current capabilities to identify its strengths and weaknesses.

Create an assessment parameters file named `assessment-params.json`:

```json
{
  "systemName": "NoCodeAI",
  "currentCapabilities": [
    "prompty-processing",
    "plugin-execution",
    "template-processing",
    "chain-of-thought-reasoning",
    "structured-output"
  ],
  "expectedCapabilities": [
    "prompty-processing",
    "plugin-execution",
    "template-processing",
    "chain-of-thought-reasoning",
    "structured-output",
    "code-generation",
    "architecture-design",
    "team-orchestration",
    "continuous-learning"
  ],
  "performanceMetrics": {
    "prompty-processing": {
      "processing_time": "650ms",
      "template_complexity": "6.2"
    },
    "plugin-execution": {
      "execution_time": "1200ms",
      "success_rate": "98.5%"
    },
    "template-processing": {
      "processing_time": "210ms",
      "memory_usage": "45MB"
    },
    "chain-of-thought-reasoning": {
      "reasoning_steps": "8",
      "reasoning_quality": "7.5",
      "token_efficiency": "520"
    },
    "structured-output": {
      "validation_success": "99.8%",
      "schema_complexity": "6.5"
    }
  }
}
```

Execute the capability assessment:

```bash
prompty-processor process-file --file "/prompty/bootstrap/assess-capabilities.prompty" --params "assessment-params.json" --output "capability-assessment.json"
```

## Step 3: Identify Capability Gaps

Next, we'll identify specific capability gaps that need to be addressed.

Create a gap identification parameters file named `gap-params.json`:

```json
{
  "systemName": "NoCodeAI",
  "currentCapabilities": [
    "prompty-processing",
    "plugin-execution",
    "template-processing",
    "chain-of-thought-reasoning",
    "structured-output"
  ],
  "expectedCapabilities": [
    "prompty-processing",
    "plugin-execution",
    "template-processing",
    "chain-of-thought-reasoning",
    "structured-output",
    "code-generation",
    "architecture-design",
    "team-orchestration",
    "continuous-learning"
  ],
  "systemGoals": [
    "Achieve autonomous code generation for complex systems",
    "Support collaborative development through team orchestration",
    "Enable continuous self-improvement through learning"
  ],
  "capabilityAssessment": "capability-assessment.json"
}
```

Execute the gap identification:

```bash
prompty-processor process-file --file "/prompty/bootstrap/identify-gaps.prompty" --params "gap-params.json" --output "capability-gaps.json"
```

## Step 4: Plan Evolution

Now we'll create a plan to evolve the system by implementing the missing capabilities.

Create an evolution planning parameters file named `evolution-params.json`:

```json
{
  "systemName": "NoCodeAI",
  "currentCapabilities": [
    "prompty-processing",
    "plugin-execution",
    "template-processing",
    "chain-of-thought-reasoning",
    "structured-output"
  ],
  "identifiedGaps": "capability-gaps.json",
  "evolutionGoals": [
    "Achieve autonomous code generation for complex systems",
    "Support collaborative development through team orchestration",
    "Enable continuous self-improvement through learning"
  ]
}
```

Execute the evolution planning:

```bash
prompty-processor process-file --file "/prompty/evolution/plan-evolution.prompty" --params "evolution-params.json" --output "evolution-plan.json"
```

## Step 5: Generate New Plugin

Let's implement one of the identified capability gaps by generating a new plugin.

Create a plugin generation parameters file named `plugin-gen-params.json`:

```json
{
  "pluginName": "CodeGeneration",
  "pluginPurpose": "Generate high-quality code from requirements and specifications",
  "requiredFunctions": [
    {
      "name": "AnalyzeRequirements",
      "description": "Analyzes requirements to identify key components and functionality",
      "parameters": "requirementSpec: string",
      "returnType": "string"
    },
    {
      "name": "GenerateClassStructure",
      "description": "Generates the class structure for a component",
      "parameters": "name: string, purpose: string, responsibilities: string, dependencies: string, languageFramework: string, codeStandards: string",
      "returnType": "string"
    },
    {
      "name": "ImplementComponent",
      "description": "Implements a component with full functionality",
      "parameters": "name: string, purpose: string, responsibilities: string, dependencies: string, languageFramework: string, codeStandards: string",
      "returnType": "string"
    }
  ],
  "integrationPoints": [
    {
      "name": "RequirementsAnalysis",
      "target": "System",
      "method": "ParseRequirements"
    },
    {
      "name": "CodeGeneration",
      "target": "Templates",
      "method": "ApplyCodeTemplate"
    }
  ],
  "performanceRequirements": {
    "generation_time": "< 5000ms",
    "code_quality": "> 8.0",
    "compilation_success": "> 99%"
  }
}
```

Execute the plugin generation:

```bash
prompty-processor process-file --file "/prompty/evolution/generate-plugin.prompty" --params "plugin-gen-params.json" --output "code-plugin.json"
```

## Step 6: Evaluate Evolution

After implementing the improvements, we evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution.

Create an evaluation parameters file named `eval-params.json`:

```json
{
  "systemName": "NoCodeAI",
  "initialCapabilities": [
    "prompty-processing",
    "plugin-execution",
    "template-processing",
    "chain-of-thought-reasoning",
    "structured-output"
  ],
  "currentCapabilities": [
    "prompty-processing",
    "plugin-execution",
    "template-processing",
    "chain-of-thought-reasoning",
    "structured-output",
    "code-generation"
  ],
  "implementedImprovements": [
    {
      "name": "CodeGeneration Plugin",
      "description": "Added code generation capabilities",
      "goalAchievement": "Partial achievement of autonomous code generation goal"
    },
    {
      "name": "Prompty Processing Optimization",
      "description": "Optimized prompty processing for better performance",
      "goalAchievement": "Improved core capability performance"
    }
  ],
  "evolutionGoals": [
    "Achieve autonomous code generation for complex systems",
    "Support collaborative development through team orchestration",
    "Enable continuous self-improvement through learning"
  ],
  "performanceMetrics": {
    "prompty-processing": {
      "processing_time": "450ms",
      "template_complexity": "6.8"
    },
    "plugin-execution": {
      "execution_time": "950ms",
      "success_rate": "99.2%"
    },
    "code-generation": {
      "code_quality": "8.2",
      "compilation_success": "99.1%",
      "test_coverage": "88%"
    }
  }
}
```

Execute the evolution evaluation:

```bash
prompty-processor process-file --file "/prompty/evolution/evaluate-evolution.prompty" --params "eval-params.json" --output "evolution-evaluation.json"
```

## The Self-Evolution Process

The self-evolution process is iterative and can be visualized as follows:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current capabilities
2. **Gap Identification**: Identify missing or underperforming capabilities
3. **Planning**: Create a plan to address the gaps
4. **Implementation**: Implement the improvements
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of the improvements
6. **Iteration**: Return to step 1 with the enhanced capabilities

This cycle continues, allowing the system to continuously improve and expand its capabilities over time.

## Benefits of Self-Evolution

The self-evolution capability provides several benefits:

1. **Continuous Improvement**: The system gets better over time.
2. **Adaptability**: The system can adapt to new requirements and technologies.
3. **Targeted Enhancement**: Resources are focused on the most critical gaps.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Existing capabilities are continuously refined.
5. **Capability Expansion**: New capabilities are added in a structured manner.

By implementing this self-evolution cycle, the NoCodeAI system becomes more capable and effective over time, without requiring manual redesign or reimplementation.
